# Portfolio Project

This is a simple portfolio project where you can showcase your work, skills, and projects by simply updating a `data.json` file. You can also customize the code to suit your design or layout preferences. This project uses VUE JS for ease of use and flexibility.

## Features

- **Easy Customization**: Update your portfolio content by editing the `data.json` fileâ€”no need to touch the code unless you want to customize the design.
